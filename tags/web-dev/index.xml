&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is a parent knows that all those &amp;ldquo;humming bears&amp;rdquo; and shushing toys can be a lifesaver when facing the task of putting a child to sleep. The physical shushing mascot is becoming a bit of a thing of the past these days. Firstly, it’s not necessarily the favorite plushie your little one wants to sleep with, and secondly, there are limitations you have to deal with in that situation. I used to use an app, the name of which I can’t even remember anymore. As long as it worked, I didn&amp;rsquo;t touch it. But&amp;hellip; an unnecessary &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; phone suddenly changed its status to &amp;ldquo;needed,&amp;rdquo; and its place was taken by an old &lt;strong&gt;iPhone 6&lt;/strong&gt; running on &lt;strong&gt;iOS 12&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
