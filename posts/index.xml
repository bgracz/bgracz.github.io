&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is a parent knows that all those &amp;ldquo;humming bears&amp;rdquo; and shushing toys can be a lifesaver when facing the task of putting a child to sleep. The physical shushing mascot is becoming a bit of a thing of the past these days. Firstly, it’s not necessarily the favorite plushie your little one wants to sleep with, and secondly, there are limitations you have to deal with in that situation. I used to use an app, the name of which I can’t even remember anymore. As long as it worked, I didn&amp;rsquo;t touch it. But&amp;hellip; an unnecessary &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; phone suddenly changed its status to &amp;ldquo;needed,&amp;rdquo; and its place was taken by an old &lt;strong&gt;iPhone 6&lt;/strong&gt; running on &lt;strong&gt;iOS 12&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Processing in Power Automate &gt;5000 rows</title><link>https://bgracz.github.io/posts/power-automate-batch-processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 08:55:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://bgracz.github.io/posts/power-automate-batch-processing/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="what-we-want-to-achieve"&gt;What we want to achieve?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Automate&lt;/strong&gt; from Microsoft is a powerful automation tool. It allows you to really simplify your work by creating a flow that will process large amounts of data. Thanks to the &lt;em&gt;schedule&lt;/em&gt; option, all the work can be done at night, and in the morning, when you sit down to work, you have the finished result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that right from the start, we encounter a significant limitation that, at first glance, may completely disqualify the further use of Power Automate—the limit on the amount of data we can process. While this is not so critical in the case of an &lt;strong&gt;SQL&lt;/strong&gt; database, for &lt;strong&gt;Excel&lt;/strong&gt;, which remains the most popular &lt;em&gt;database&lt;/em&gt; in most companies, it is a disqualification right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
